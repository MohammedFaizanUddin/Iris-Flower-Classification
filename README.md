# Iris-Flower-Classification
The Iris Flower dataset is a classic dataset that is often used for introductory machine learning projects. The goal of this project is to train a machine learning model that can accurately classify the species of an Iris flower based on its characteristics.

Data:

The dataset contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, each with four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) and one target variable (species: setosa, versicolor, or virginica).

Approach:

Data Exploration:
Import necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, matplotlib)
Load the dataset into a pandas dataframe
Check for missing values and handle them accordingly (e.g., drop or impute missing values)
Explore the data using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots)
Feature Engineering:
Split the data into training and testing sets
Standardize the feature values to ensure that they are on the same scale
Model Selection and Training:
Import necessary libraries (e.g., sklearn)
Initialize and train various machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Random Forest)
Evaluate the performance of each model using cross-validation and select the best performing one
Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the performance of the selected model on the testing set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Deployment:
Deploy the selected model in a web-based application that allows the user to input the values for the four features of an Iris flower and receive a prediction of its species
